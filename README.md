Best Practices Followed
Semantic HTML: Used tags like <header>, <nav>, <section>, and <footer> for better structure and accessibility.

CSS Organization: Styles are organized and commented for clarity.

Accessibility: All images have alt attributes, and the website is designed to be screen-reader friendly.

Performance Optimization: Images are optimized for faster loading times.

Future Enhancements
Add more interactive features using JavaScript (e.g., animations, form validation).

Integrate a backend to dynamically load content (e.g., courses, testimonials).

Implement a blog section with a CMS (Content Management System) for easy updates.
